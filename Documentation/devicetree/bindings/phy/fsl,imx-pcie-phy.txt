* Freescale i.MX PCIE PHY binding

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "fsl,imx-pcie-phy"
- #phys-cells:	must be 0 (see phy-bindings.txt in this directory)
- reg:		The base address and length of the registers
- clocks:	Phandles to the clocks for each clock listed in clock-names
- clock-names:	Must contain "phy"
- clk_mode:	Specify the reference clock source. Three clock sources can be
  used as PCIe PHY reference clock on iMX8MP PCIe. Use clk_mode to specify it.
  1: PLL_XO, 2: EXT_OSC, 3: PLL_SYS.
- power-domains: Phandle to the power domain that the device is part of

Example:
	pcie_phy: pcie-phy@32f00000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx8mp-pcie-phy";
		reg = <0x0 0x32f00000 0x0 0x10000>;
		clocks = <&clk IMX8MP_CLK_PCIE_PHY>;
		clock-names = "phy";
		assigned-clocks = <&clk IMX8MP_CLK_PCIE_PHY>;
		assigned-clock-parents = <&clk IMX8MP_CLK_24M>;
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		power-domains = <&pcie_pd>;
		status = "disabled";
	};
